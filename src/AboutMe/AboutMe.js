                    Hello! In my free time, I love playing volleyball, working out, puzzles, and being around my family. My passion for learning and creating has driven me to pursue front-end software development. My passion began from doing countless jigsaw puzzles and sudokus which led me to find a career where I could use my brain in the same capacity.

                    I joined the Marine Corps when I turned 18, where I worked on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's). I did two deployments to the Philippines where we helped aided MARSOC in surveillance to fight ISIS. My job included: Launching and recovering the UAV, fueling and defueling, maintenance and supervision of others, and troubleshooting when an issue arose. While I loved working on UAV's, I felt it was time to leave the Marine Corps and pursue other careers.

                    Soon after my enlistment, I got a job working on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), where I got to experience working with people from all different countries while traveling around the globe. I worked with people from Norway, India, UK, Mexico, Poland, France, Sweden and more! We traveled on a ship doing various surveys for: Oil and Gas companies, electric vehicle companies, treasure hunters, scientists, and search and recoveries.

                    While traveling around the world and experiencing the melting pot of culture, I felt drawn to pursue software engineering and have found my love and desire to learn more things grows everyday!
